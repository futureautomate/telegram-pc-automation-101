We will then create a function to handle messages and write the code to echo the message back to the user. After that, we will start the bot and handle updates using the "updater" class.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a working Telegram bot that can echo messages. You can then expand upon this by adding more functionality to the bot.

This tutorial is perfect for beginners who want to learn how to create a Telegram bot using Python. No prior programming experience is required.

Step 1: Set up a Telegram bot

- First, you will need to create a new bot on Telegram by talking to the "BotFather" on Telegram.
- Once you have created the bot, you will be given a unique API token that you will use to access the Telegram API - [https://sendpulse.com/knowledge-base/chatbot/telegram/create-telegram-chatbot](https://sendpulse.com/knowledge-base/chatbot/telegram/create-telegram-chatbot)

Step 2: Install the python-telegram-bot library

- In order to interact with the Telegram API, we will be using the python-telegram-bot library. - pip install python-telegram-bot
- You can install it by running "pip install python-telegram-bot" in your command line.

Step 3: Import the library and set up the bot

- Next, we will import the library and set up the bot using the API token we obtained from the BotFather.

Step 4: Create a function to handle messages

- We will create a function that will be called every time a message is sent to the bot.
- This function will simply echo the message back to the user.

Step 5: Start the bot and handle updates

- Finally, we will start the bot and use the "updater" class to handle any updates (i.e. new messages) that come in.

Step 6: Test the bot

- Now you can test the bot by sending it a message, and it will respond with the same message.
